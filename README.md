# Yet Another Simple Ray Tracer

![The Current Output](https://github.com/mjalen/ray-tracer/blob/main/output.png?raw=true)

This project is a learning exercise with a few objectives:

- Learn basic graphical programming.
- Learn the Rust programming language.
- Have fun! :D

This project is based on the book ['Ray Tracing in One Weekend'](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley. This is my first time reading this book and it is very helpful and fast. I am porting and expanding their code to my taste.

This project uses the Rust programming language. There are two reasons for this. The first is that I learn quicker by re-writing content in my own words. Translating from C++ to Rust is helpful because it has me THINK about what the code I am copying does. The second reason for using Rust is the hype. I have heard a lot of hype around Rust and was curious how great it really was. Spoilers: Rust is awesome.
